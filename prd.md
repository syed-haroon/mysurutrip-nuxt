## **üìù PRD ‚Äì Tourism Lead Capture MVP**

### **1. Overview**

A fast, SEO-friendly tourism site for Mysuru (and later other locations) that drives organic & social traffic, subtly captures leads via a dynamic trip request form, and nurtures them via WhatsApp Business broadcasts.
No real-time pricing, booking engine, or sign-up required ‚Äî focus is on *engagement ‚Üí lead capture ‚Üí personal quote*.

### **2. Goals**

* Generate **high-intent tourism leads**.
* Keep UX **frictionless** while still capturing essential trip details.
* Support **customizable itineraries** based on trip type (honeymoon, family, corporate, solo).
